# Description
PrintRdy is a software coded in Python that allows you to easily convert .USDZ files into .STL files that are ready to be sliced and 3D printed. This means you can use your iPhone to create LiDAR scans using Apple's "Reality Composer" app to turn real world objects into digital files.
